# Credit-Risk-Classification

In this challenge, we're using different methods to train and evaluate a model that focuses on assessing the risk associated with loans. We're using data from the past lending activities of a peer-to-peer lending company to create a model that can tell us how creditworthy potential borrowers are.

Credit Risk Analysis Report

Purpose of Analysis:
The main goal of this analysis is to create and check how well a data model can predict if someone is creditworthy or not, especially in the context of peer-to-peer lending.

Accuracy, Precision, and Recall Scores:

Balanced Accuracy Score: 95.20% — This means that the model is about 95.2% accurate when considering both how well it catches positive cases (sensitivity or recall) and how well it identifies negative cases (specificity or true negative rate).
Precision Score: 92% — This shows that 92% of the times the model says someone is creditworthy, it's correct.
Recall Score: 95% — This indicates that the model is about 95% precise in finding truly creditworthy people out of all the cases it predicts as positive.
Summary of Results:
I suggest using this model for predicting the creditworthiness of borrowers because it's impressively accurate, with an accuracy level exceeding 95%. This high accuracy can be strategically used to manage business risks, ensuring a consistent flow of funds for lenders, ultimately supporting the long-term success and profitability of the business.
